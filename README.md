###	Project Summary

Espionage is a text-based game that takes elements of classic Dungeons and Dragons skill-tracking and Create Your Own Adventure story progression.

Players will have to pass tests of stealth, perception, and marksmanship in order to stop the worst from happening (especially getting stabbed in the back right away).
