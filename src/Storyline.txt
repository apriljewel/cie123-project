{
	You've just left the spy agency when you instinctively spot someone familiar,
	a stranger whose face you've seen for the third time this week. You think
	to yourself, 'Who is this man?' He's got a black hat and sunglasses along
	with a long coat with his hands snugly placed in his pockets. 'The typical
	appearance of someone mischievous,' you cleverly think to yourself. Do you
		[A1]	[1] approach the man, or
		[A2]	[2] walk past him like you always do?
}

(A1) {
	'I've noticed you around before. Do you need anything?' you ask. Before you
	were able to finish though, he hastily waves his hand and shrugs as if to say
	he doesn't want to be disturbed and walks away unsteadily. You leave the
	scene behind and get to your car. As you close the door you notice people
	rushing out of the agency. Do you
		[B1]	[1] get out and investigate, or
		[B2]	[2] call your partner who's still in the building?
}

(A2) {
	You ignored your gut feeling and walk away. The man quietly follows and stabs
	you from behind. You are now dead.
		[END]
}

(B1) {
	You rush back towards the building and see the same man quickly turning on
	the next block. Do you
		[C1]	[1] chase after him, or
		[C2]	[2] call your partner who's still in the building?
}

(B2) {
	The other end rings but no one picks up. Do you
		[C3]	[1] keep trying, or
		[C4]	[2] enter the building?
}

(C1) {
	You reach the next block as quickly as possible, but as you turn around the
	corner, you see a door slam shut a few meters away. Do you
		[D1]	[1] go the same way, or
		[D2]	[2] find an alternative route?
}

(C2) {
	Your partner answers and you find out that a few men have been shot in the
	building. The two of you quickly agree to chase the suspect. As you meet him
	however, you see he's been wounded. Do you
		[D3]	[1] mend his wound, or
		[D4]	[2] carry on with your mission?
}

(C3) {
	The call ins answered by an unknown voice. He summons you to enter the
	building to save your partner. Do you
		[D5]	[1] follow the instructions, or
		[D6]	[2] try to call someone else?
}

(C4) {
	You try to ask the people rushing out what has happened, but no one hears you
	as they sprint to the exits. Do you
		[D7]	[1] follow everyone back outside, or
		[D8]	[2] keep going inside?
}

(D1) {
	You push the door, but it doesn't open. Do you
		[E1]	[1] use your gun, or
		[E2]	[2] use your lock pick?
}

(D2) {
	You decide to enter the next building. You reach the roof top and spot the
	man still running. Do you
		[E3]	[1] try to shoot him, or
		[E4]	[2] keep chasing him?
}

(D3) {
	You re-enter the building to get a medicine kit. Your partner insists on not
	wasting time and quickly wraps his wound with a roll of bandage. Soon after
	you two are on your way, someone shoots in your direction. Do you
		[E3]	[1] shoot back, or
		[E5]	[2] evade and sneak towards the shooter?
}

(D4) {
	You quickly remember the direction the mischievous man had taken earlier and
	follow it. To make sure, you describe the man to some passers-by and are
	propitiously directed the right way. Do you
		[E6]	[1] try to track down the assassin, or
		[E7]	[2] try to involve a bigger team on the mission?
}

(D5) {
	You cautiously re-enter the building and head to your office. The mischievous
	man is standing behind your friend. He asks for top secret information. Do
	you
		[E8]	[1] shoot first, or
		[E9]	[2] give him false information?
}

(D6) {
	Surprisingly, the assassin got hold of this number too. Do you
		[E10]	[1] call a third number just to make sure, or
		[D5]	[2] follow his previous instructions?
}

(D7) {
	As you near the exit, you hear shots from behind the group of people trying
	to escape. The crowd is in chaos. Do you
		[E11]	[1] try to fire some shots, or
		[E12]	[2] run with the crowd?
}

(D8) {
	You cautiously examine each floor. As you reach the third, you hear mumbling
	voices in a room. You sneak through the door and see the mischievous man from
	earlier with someone else in similar clothes vigorously going through top
	secret files. Do you
		[E13]	[1] shoot at them, or
		[E14]	[2] call for help?
}

(E1) {
	The lock breaks. You push the door open and find a flight of stairs. You hear
	someone running up and you point your gun towards the man. Unfortunately,
	you've wasted your last bullet breaking the lock. The man aims and shoots
	you directly in the head.
		[END]
	
}

(E2) {
	You waste around 10 seconds unlocking the door. The man has reached the top
	of the building and aims his gun at you. You are now dead.
		[END]
}

(E3) {
	Your shots connect. The assassin is dead.
		[END]
}

(E4) {
	You face a battle with the assassin.
		[END]
}

(E5) {
	You ambush the assassin and face a battle with him.
		[END] 
}

(E6) {
	The directions given were pointless. The assassin took a circular route, and
	has managed to escape.
		[END]
}

(E7) {
	The mission is off your hands now.
		[END]
}

(E8) {
	Your shots connect. The assassin is dead. Unfortunately, so is your friend.
		[END]
}

(E9) {
	The man plays along, but senses the deception. Mid-sentence, you hear a gun
	shot and your friend's body hit the floor. You hear another gun shot and your
	body follows your friend's.
		[END]
}

(E10) {
	You've underestimated the man when he answers for the third time. But another
	chance is not given. He shoots your friend, and shoots you through the
	window of your office. You and your friend are now dead.
		[END]
}

(E11) {
	After a few shots, the crowd calms down enough for the assassin to aim at
	your head. One more gun shot is heard.
		[END]
}

(E12) {
	At this point, the assassin only wants to get out of the building as quickly
	as possibly. He shoots whoever's in his way...including you.
		[END]
}

(E13) {
	You ambush both men and manage to subdue them. Mission accomplished.
		[END]
}

(E14) {
	They hear you before your help arrives and proceed to shoot at you.
		[END]
