(A1) {
You've just left the spy agency when you instinctively spot someone familiar,
a stranger whose face you've seen for the third time this week. You think
to yourself, 'Who is this man?' He's got a black hat and sunglasses along
with a long coat with his hands snugly placed in his pockets. 'The typical
appearance of someone mischievous,' you cleverly think to yourself. Do you
	[B1]	approach the man, or
	[B2]	walk past him like you always do?
}

(B1) {
'I've noticed you around before. Do you need anything?' you ask. Before you
were able to finish though, he hastily waves his hand and shrugs as if to say
he doesn't want to be disturbed and walks away unsteadily. You leave the
scene behind and get to your car. As you close the door you notice people
rushing out of the agency. Do you
	[C1]	get out and investigate, or
	[C2]	call your partner who's still in the building?
}

(B2) {
You ignored your gut feeling and walk away. The man quietly follows and stabs
you from behind. You are now dead.
	[END]
}

(C1) {
You rush back towards the building and see the same man quickly turning on
the next block. Do you
	[D1]	chase after him, or
	[D2]	call your partner who's still in the building?
}

(C2) {
The other end rings but no one picks up. Do you
	[D3]	keep trying, or
	[D4]	enter the building?
}

(D1) {
You reach the next block as quickly as possible, but as you turn around the
corner, you see a door slam shut a few meters away. Do you
	[E1]	go the same way, or
	[E2]	find an alternative route?
}

(D2) {
Your partner answers and you find out that a few men have been shot in the
building. The two of you quickly agree to chase the suspect. As you meet him
however, you see he's been wounded. Do you
	[E3]	mend his wound, or
	[E4]	carry on with your mission?
}

(D3) {
The call is answered by an unknown voice. He summons you to enter the
building to save your partner. Do you
	[E5]	follow the instructions, or
	[E6]	try to call someone else?
}

(D4) {
You try to ask the people rushing out what has happened, but no one hears you
as they sprint to the exits. Do you
	[E7]	follow everyone back outside, or
	[E8]	keep going inside?
}

(E1) {
You push the door, but it doesn't open. Do you
	[F1]	use your gun, or
	[F2]	use your lock pick?
}

(E2) {
You decide to enter the next building. You reach the roof top and spot the
man still running. Do you
	[F3]	try to shoot him, or
	[F4]	keep chasing him?
}

(E3) {
You re-enter the building to get a medicine kit. Your partner insists on not
wasting time and quickly wraps his wound with a roll of bandage. Soon after
you two are on your way, someone shoots in your direction. Do you
	[F3]	shoot back, or
	[F5]	evade and sneak towards the shooter?
}

(E4) {
You quickly remember the direction the mischievous man had taken earlier and
follow it. To make sure, you describe the man to some passers-by and are
propitiously directed the right way. Do you
	[F6]	try to track down the assassin, or
	[F7]	try to involve a bigger team on the mission?
}

(E5) {
You cautiously re-enter the building and head to your office. The mischievous
man is standing behind your friend. He asks for top secret information. Do
you
	[F8]	shoot first, or
	[F9]	give him false information?
}

(E6) {
Surprisingly, the assassin got hold of this number too. Do you
	[F10]	call a third number just to make sure, or
	[E5]	follow his previous instructions?
}

(E7) {
As you near the exit, you hear shots from behind the group of people trying
to escape. The crowd is in chaos. Do you
	[F11]	try to fire some shots, or
	[F12]	run with the crowd?
}

(E8) {
You cautiously examine each floor. As you reach the third, you hear mumbling
voices in a room.
<SNEAK>
(PASS) {
You sneak through the door and see the mischievous man from
earlier with someone else in similar clothes vigorously going through top
secret files. Do you
	[F13]	shoot at them, or
	[F14]	call for help?
}
(FAIL) {
You weren't as sneaky as you had hoped. The two men pull out their
guns and shoot one bullet each in your direction. You promptly fall over
dead.
	[END]
}}

(F1) {
The lock breaks. You push the door open and find a flight of stairs. You hear
someone running up and you point your gun towards the man. Unfortunately,
you've wasted your last bullet breaking the lock. The man aims and shoots
you directly in the head.
	[END]
	
}

(F2) {
<LOCKPICK>
(PASS) {
You waste no time picking the lock. You push open the door and find a flight
of stairs. You see the man running up. Do you
	[F3]	shoot at him, or
	[F4]	chase him down?
} 
(FAIL) {
You waste too much time unlocking the door. The man has reached the top
of the building and aims his gun at you. In a matter of seconds, you are
dead.
	[END]
}}

(F3) {
Your shots connect. The assassin is dead.
	[END]
}

(F4) {
You face a battle with the assassin.
	[END]
}

(F5) {
You ambush the assassin and face a battle with him.
	[END] 
}

(F6) {
The directions given were pointless. The assassin took a circular route, and
has managed to escape.
	[END]
}

(F7) {
The mission is off your hands now.
	[END]
}

(F8) {
Your shots connect. The assassin is dead. Unfortunately, so is your friend.
	[END]
}

(F9) {
The man plays along, but senses the deception. Mid-sentence, you hear a gun
shot and your friend's body hit the floor. You hear another gun shot and your
body follows your friend's.
	[END]
}

(F10) {
You've underestimated the man when he answers for the third time. But another
chance is not given. He shoots your friend, and shoots you through the
window of your office. You and your friend are now dead.
	[END]
}

(F11) {
After a few shots, the crowd calms down enough for the assassin to aim at
your head. One more gun shot is heard.
	[END]
}

(F12) {
At this point, the assassin only wants to get out of the building as quickly
as possibly. He shoots whoever's in his way...including you.
	[END]
}

(F13) {
You ambush both men and manage to subdue them. Mission accomplished.
	[END]
}

(F14) {
They hear you before your help arrives and proceed to shoot at you.
	[END]
